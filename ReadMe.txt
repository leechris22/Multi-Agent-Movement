1) What are the weights of the three steering behaviors in your flocking model?

Separation - 2
Cohesion - 1.5
Alignment - 1

2) In Part 2, what did you do for avoiding a group of agents? What are the weights of
path following and evade behavior? Did you use a separation algorithm, and what
were its parameters?

3) In Part 3, how many rays did you use in your ray-casting, and why?
